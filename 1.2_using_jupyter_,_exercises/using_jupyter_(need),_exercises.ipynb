    "Ans: The Git repository is where a mass of code is stored and where changes to said code can be checked and tapped on should something happens.\n",

    "4. What is a **push**?  \n",
    "Ans: A push is to share the changes that were made locally on the computer up to the Git repository cloud (online).\n",
